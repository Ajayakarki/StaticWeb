			<figcaption> <h2>Legendary singer Gyanu Rana to be honoured with concert</h2> <br> It might not be untoward to assume that every Nepali music fan knows the words to the sombre, breezy classic Nepali adhunik song Siri ma Siri ni Kanchhi by heart.This perennial favourite from Nepal’s golden age of music is a duet, with swor samrat Narayan Gopal’s mellifluous voice playing off of Gyanu Rana’s high timbre, nostalgia-tinged vocals. Rana might not be as popular as Gopal is, but in her more than four decade-long music career, Rana has performed over 3,500 songs, including such classics as Sallai ho Jovan Kallai Ho and Manchhe ko Maya Yaha.today, February 5, The Hidden Treasure, a Lalitpur-based event management company, is organising a concert in honour of this legendary singer.“Rana is one of those rare musicians who has dedicated herself to Nepali music for such a long time, and has done so steadily and with passion. It is to honour her that we decided to organise this event,” Subarna Bahadur Chhetri, director of The Hidden Treasure, told the Post. “We have a tendency to shower praise and honour only after people have died. But we decided to honour deserving musicians while they are still alive.”The concert will feature singers such as Suraj Kumar Thapa, Prashna Shakya, Meena Niraula, Sarita Shahi, Bikash Rana, and Mahendra Shrestha, all offering renditions of Rana’s hits. Music will be conducted by Raju Singh with a full orchestra.The concert will also see Rana herself sing some of her famous songs.
			“I just feel happy,” Rana said in an interview with the Post. “While the older generation of musicians are largely ignored by the state, a private organisation putting up a platform to honour older generation musicians is a good thing.”
			Rana, who is 69, said that while she continues to sing, she has lately been drawn towards bhajans rather than classical adhunik songs, which is what has long defined her.
			The event, titled ‘Abiral Yatra’, is part of the The Hidden Treasure’s annual felicitation programme where the company pays tribute to a living musical legend. The programme has so far honoured lyricist and film pioneer Yadav Kharel and composer and singer Deepak Jangam.
