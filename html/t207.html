			<figcaption> <h2>Indian Ambassador Ranjit Roy said India will support the bid for seeking political consensus in Nepal.</h2> <br>KATHMANDU:  Indian Ambassador Ranjit Rae said today the country will support the bid for seeking political consensus among the government, opposition and agitating Madhesi political parties in Nepal.The ongoing agitation and unrest in the Tarai was a "political problem", Mr Rae said today after receiving a memorandum from the Reporters Club Nepal.Stating that the standoff between the government and the agitating parties should be resolved through dialogue, Mr Rae said: "We (India) support the bid on seeking political solution by parties and the government here and wish that it should be result-oriented and meaningful."He said a broad framework for seeking solution has already been prepared, and if talks take place in a serious manner, a solution was near.The Indian envoy also urged all sides to maintain flexibility in talks."We do not have other interest in Nepal besides its stability and development," he said.
			"We are concerned because any unrest in Tarai has direct implications in India and instability in the neighbourhood has implications in India's development too," he said.
			"Our only one interest in Nepal is its stability and peace," he said.
			"We want to see peace and stability in the region. If there is instability in Nepal, we will also suffer, so we want to see stability in Nepal," Mr Rae stressed.
			The Indian envoy said no one can disturb the age-old relations between Nepal and India, but due to proximity, sometimes "ups and downs" may occur which can be resolved through talks.
			"The present standoff in the relations is temporary and it will deepen automatically and it does not have any alternative too," he added.
			He also called for implementation of the power trading agreement and project development agreement signed by Nepal and India.

			"If a good project is implemented, it will give a positive message," said Mr Rae.
