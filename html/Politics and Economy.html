					<h4>Cricket star-turned-politician Imran Khan, chairman of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), speaks to members of media after<br> casting his vote at a polling station during the general election in Islamabad, Pakistan</h4>
					<p> Pakistan’s prime minister and president on Tuesday offered support for rebels in the Indian part of the disputed Himalayan territory<br> of Kashmir as the country staged rallies marking the annual Day of Solidarity with Kashmir.Rallies were also held in the Pakistani-<br> controlled sector of the territory while a Pakistani minister declared the struggle of the rebels in Kashmir a jihad, or Muslim holy war,<br> saying it would go on until Kashmir becomes part of Pakistan.India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir, but both claim<br> the territory in its entirety. Rebels have been fighting Indian rule since 1989, demanding Indian-controlled Kashmir be united either<br> under Pakistani rule or established as an independent country.
					Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and President Arif Alvi in their<br> statements condemned India for what they said were violations of human rights in the Indian section of Kashmir. They said Pakistan<br> would continue its “diplomatic and moral” support for people living in Kashmir.
					“The wish of Kashmiri people for freedom cannot be<br> suppressed,” Alvi told lawmakers in the Pakistani-controlled part of Kashmir.
					In Islamabad, Ali Amin Gundapur, a minister in charge<br> of Kashmir affairs, told a rally that “one day, Kashmir will become part of Pakistan.”
					Army spokesman Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor tweeted<br> that decades of “atrocities by Indian occupied forces have failed to suppress ever strengthening freedom struggle” of the Kashmiris.<br>
					At a rally in Peshawar, protesters burned and stomped on the Indian fag as Pakistani girls in traditional Kashmiri dress chanted anti-<br> Indian slogans.
					And at a pro-Kashmir rally in the eastern city of Lahore, Pakistani radical cleric Hafiz Saeed, suspected in the 2008<br> Mumbai terror attacks that killed 166 people and also wanted by the U.S., urged followers to stand up against India’s crackdown on<br> “unarmed civilians in Kashmir.”
					There was no immediate comment from New Delhi on the statements from Islamabad.
					On Sunday,<br> India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid a day-long visit to the Indian section of Kashmir as separatists there called for a shutdown<br> shops and businesses closed while thousands of armed government forces and commandos spread out and closed off roads with<br> razor wire and iron barricades to prevent protests and rebel attacks during Modi’s visit.</p>
